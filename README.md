### **Findings:**  
- **Plant 1** receives the highest solar power influx on **Tuesdays**.  
- **Plant 2** experiences peak power generation on **Saturdays**.  
- **Plant 2** has more variations in power output compared to Plant 1.  

### **Conclusion:**  
- To optimize energy utilization, more power should be consumed on **Tuesdays**.

## **Analysis #2 – Inverter Performance**  

### **Objective:**  
To evaluate the efficiency of inverters by comparing their power output against irradiation levels.  

### **Methodology:**  
1. Calculate **average irradiation** for both plants on a weekday basis.  
2. Analyze **average power generated by each inverter** using a color-coded mapping.  
3. Compare power output with irradiation levels to identify underperforming inverters.

### **Findings:**  
- Anomalies were detected by overlaying irradiation data with inverter performance.  
- The inverter **'bvBOhCH3iADSZry'** generates significantly lower power than expected during high irradiation periods.  

### **Conclusion:**  
- The inverter **'bvBOhCH3iADSZry'** is likely faulty and requires maintenance.
